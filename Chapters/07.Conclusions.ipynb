    "Below are the key reflections related to the three research questions, posed in the Introduction Chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How complex is it, to build a fast and reliable object detection pipeline, using *IOT* devices and *Computer Vision*?\n",
    "\n",
    "A reliable data collection stage manifested itself with a high complexity. Collecting images $24/7$ for $6$ months has challenged my problem solving skills, and thought me many valuable lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is crucial to place the camera in the right location. It required wiring the house with ethernet cables and investing in Power Over Ethernet adapters. Camera units (and *IOT* devices) placed outside of the house, need to be monitored against environmental effects: direct contact with sunlight, humidity, dust, dirt, insects and even birds can have a negative impact on the quality of collected data\n",
    "- It can get very slow to perform multiple tasks on each frame from the camera. It was made possible due to smart motion detection approach with suitable parameters (*Background Subtraction*), connected with the fast and accurate object detection algorithm (*Yolo v2*)\n",
    "- It is challenging to forward *High Definition* images in real time to a web browser from Python. It was solved through the *Socket Data Transmission* inside a separate thread\n",
    "- Software services need to start automatically when devices are rebooted or when network connections are broken. Utilizing *Supervisor* Linux utility and a proper network setup can minimize the negative impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given the collected image data with object detections, can future object counts be accurately predicted using *Machine Learning*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object counts for a given category (*Person* or *Vehicle*), can be predicted with relatively low error rates using Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process required a significant amount of image data extraction, cleaning and pre-processing. Numerous models of different type and complexity have been tested (ranging from *Linear Regression* through *Bi-Directional LTSM Neural Networks*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the evidence gathered in Chapter 5, there are two types of models, which can be successfully applied to make predictions: a probabilistic model (*Gaussian Process*) and point estimate model (*Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Regressor*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Processes have an advantage of providing uncertainty about the predictions, but Gradient Boosting models are faster to train and more robust to the object category selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does object detection data contain anomalous patterns, which can be recognized with *Anomaly Detection* algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying anomaly detection algorithms to the collected image data can generate useful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the maximum threshold of expected objects of a certain category (*Person* or *Vehicle*), in a given hour, gives the ability to flag events as anomalous, if a count within an hour is above the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of four tested methods, the *probabilistic approach*, which utilized *gamma* distribution and *Poisson* likelihood function, produced an optimal result and classified $61$ observations as anomalous out of $4140$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy to anomaly detection was to apply an Auto Encoder Neural Network directly to raw image data. This technique is an *Unsupervised Machine Learning* as the historical images are not labeled. In this case a dataset with mixed object categories can be utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to search for images which differ the most from the others, and therefore can be flagged as anomalies. This method has multiple usages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If an incoming image deviates above a specified threshold (calculated using *mean squared error*), then an alert can be triggered. Model successfully flagged many people gathered outside the house as an anomalous event\n",
    "- Thousands of images, collected throughout a single day, can be sorted from the most anomalous one, which quickly highlights the most unusual scenes in a given day\n",
    "\n",
    "While testing on a hand-labeled dataset with $30$ images, the best model was able to classify correctly $9$ out of $15$ anomalies. It yielded a *Recall score* of $0.6$, while not sacrificing the *F1 score* of $0.72$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for future iterations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO: make this section easier to read and grammatically correct!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting all the components into a fully working system could lead to other ideas and opportunities and could expose potential gaps to tweak\n",
    "- Using a professional camera with a wider field of view would result in an improvement in security. Night vision capability and a waterproof case would make it possible to mount it in a more inaccessible point\n",
    "- Exploring Object Detection on-device instead of streaming frames to a central PC could significantly reduce the cost of the setup. While Raspberry Pi itself is not powerful enough for this task, there are advances in the area, which are worth exploring (for example *NVidia Jetson Nano* or *Google Coral*)\n",
    "- Testing the system in another house. It is an interesting research question, which would assess if the models developed in this research are truly generalizable\n",
    "- Privacy mode should be incorporated. People in the detected images should be blurred to hide their identity. This is an easy Computer Vision task and an important subject in terms of ethics and how modern AI systems should work\n",
    "- Collecting data for a year or two years would create new possibilities to use more suitable forecasting models with periodicity component and ability to observe spikes in observations over the full year\n",
    "- Anomaly detection can be also improved. Using forecast predictions to find hourly anomalies, and employing a more advanced versions of the Convolutional auto encoder would be worth to study more. An investigation into using separate auto encoder models depending on the time of the day has the potential to further increase the *Recall*\n",
    "- Upgrade libraries to more accurate and faster versions (*Yolo v4* for object detection, *pymc4* for *TensorFlow-based* probabilistic programming)\n",
    "- Using *RTSP* (Real Time Streaming Protocol) instead of *Message Queue* for streaming could increase the frame rate and make the system more portable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final remark**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the findings and recommendations above, combined high velocity in the release of new research papers and libraries, show plethora of opportunities for future research in this area. This means that the system can evolve in capabilities and always become <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">more useful</span>."
