    "The idea to generate a forecast for the detected objects did not exist in this project from the beginning, when the idea was to build a toy-project to use a Raspberry Pi for real time object detection.\n",

    "The step above was accomplished within six months and an idea occurred to me during a student meetup in the university: Can detected objects be used as a dataset to predict object counts?\n",

    "Forecasting expected object counts can be very beneficial not only for our own curiosity, but also for anomaly detection. For example, if the predicted number of people at 3PM on a weekend-day is 5 and we have already observed 15 people, then something unusual must be happening and perhaps we would like to be notified about it.\n",
