    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Monitoring systems are used to keep our households safe. Some so-called **\"Smart\"** solutions, provide modern features, like motion sensing, alerts, and even object detection and recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several interviews with the owners of such systems, I have learned that they were dissatisfied with the amount of False Positive alerts when motion sensors are triggered for unexplainable reasons. They would also like their system to provide real time object detection and recognition while minimising the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea is to explore this area in a great detail and propose a new, Machine Learning driven system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will collect and use object detections captured from camera, combined with additional data sources (like weather data), to generate a forecast of objects expected to see in a given time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will then use Machine Learning to exploit irregularites in the data and classify observations as anomalies if they don't follow the normal trend."
