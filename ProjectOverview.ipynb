    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Monitoring systems are used to keep our households safe. Some so-called smart solutions, provide modern features, like motion sensing, alerts, and even object detection and recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several interviews with the owners of such systems, I have learned that they were dissatisfied with the amount of False Positive alerts. They would also like their system to provide real time object detection and recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea is to explore this area in a great detail and propose a new system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will collect and use the object detections data combined with additional data sources (like Weather-Data) to generate a forecast of objects expected to see in a given time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will then use Machine Learning to exploit regularites in the data and classify observations as anomalies if they don't follow the normal trend."

    "## Thesis overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that this type of project requires a 5 separate areas to explore and an engineer to choose the best possible solution with the time and resources at hand.\n",

    "I would like to stress to the Reader, that this project has gone through a number of iterations:\n",
    "- At first it was just a toy project of using the camera on a Raspberry Pi\n",
    "- Then a break through idea came up to use these detection to generate a future forecast for objects\n",
    "- And finally - to make the system really usefull - an idea for alerts completed the scope\n",
